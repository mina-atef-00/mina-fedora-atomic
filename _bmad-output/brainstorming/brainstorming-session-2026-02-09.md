# Brainstorming Session Results

**Facilitator:** Monna
**Date:** 2026-02-09

## Session Overview

**Topic:** Git Safety Agent - Failsafe Git Operations with Intelligent Commit Management
**Goals:** Create a bulletproof git agent that prevents repo corruption, supports conventional commits, rebasing, cherry-picking, worktrees, commit splitting/amending, while maintaining full safety and awareness

### Context Guidance

Agent creation context focused on discovering vivid personality and clear utility. Emphasis on WHO the agent is (identity/personality) and WHAT they do (git operations with safety guarantees).

### Session Setup

Collaborative brainstorming to explore identity, voice, capabilities, and architecture for a failsafe git management agent.

## Technique Selection

**Approach:** User-Selected Techniques
**Selected Techniques:**

1. **SCAMPER Method** - Systematic creativity through seven lenses
2. **Resource Constraints** - Extreme limitations force creative efficiency
3. **Trait Transfer** - Borrow attributes from successful solutions
4. **What If Scenarios** - Radical possibility exploration
5. **Analogical Thinking** - Cross-domain pattern transfer
6. **Reversal Inversion** - Deliberate problem flipping
7. **Metaphor Mapping** - Extended metaphor thinking tools
8. **Concept Blending** - Merging concepts for new categories
9. **Five Whys** - Root cause drilling
10. **Question Storming** - Problem definition through questions
11. **Failure Analysis** - Learning from what didn't work

**Selection Rationale:** Mix of structured thinking, creative innovation, introspective exploration, and deep analysis to comprehensively design a surgical precisionist git agent with zero-risk operations.

## Technique Execution Results

### SCAMPER Method + Deep Dive on Reverse Workflow

**Key Breakthroughs:**

**[SCAMPER-1]**: Dry-Run Verification Gateway
_Concept_: Substitute manual commands with verified dry-run previews that show exactly what will happen before execution, requiring explicit confirmation.
_Novelty_: Prevents "oops" moments by making destructive operations require active consent after preview.

**[SCAMPER-2]**: Air Traffic Controller Persona
_Concept_: Agent acts as air traffic controller managing git operations flow - coordinating, sequencing, and preventing collisions between operations.
_Novelty_: Shifts from passive tool to active coordinator with situational awareness.

**[SCAMPER-3]**: Medical Time-Out Protocol
_Concept_: Adapt surgical "time out" procedures - pause before finalizing to verify: right operation, right files, right commit message, right branch.
_Novelty_: Brings life-critical safety culture to version control.

**[SCAMPER-4]**: Zero-Step Conventional Commits
_Concept_: Eliminate complexity by automatically categorizing and formatting conventional commits based on file changes and context.
_Novelty_: Removes friction entirely - user just approves, agent handles format.

**[REVERSE-1]**: Intent-Driven Git Operations
_Concept_: User declares outcomes ("split this commit", "move to feature branch"), agent simulates forward from current state to find safe path to goal.
_Novelty_: Shifts cognitive load from "how do I do this?" to "is this what I want?"

**[REVERSE-2]**: Safety-First Simulation Engine
_Concept_: Agent constantly checks git status + recent history + user goal + safety constraints to calculate verified safe routes.
_Novelty_: Every operation path is pre-validated against corruption scenarios.

**[REVERSE-3]**: Intelligent Ambiguity Resolution
_Concept_: Agent asks clarifying questions only when user intent is unclear, remembers patterns over time, gets smarter with use.
_Novelty_: Balances automation with human judgment at decision points.

**[REVERSE-4]**: Hybrid UI Experience
_Concept_: Natural language input with visual confirmation - type "I want to..." see interactive path selection, confirm visually.
_Novelty_: Combines conversational ease with visual clarity.

**[REVERSE-5]**: Context-Aware Undo
_Concept_: Multiple undo strategies depending on context - operation journal, Time Machine view, or recovery mode based on what user needs.
_Novelty_: Adapts undo approach to situation rather than one-size-fits-all.

**[REVERSE-6]**: Surgical Precisionist Qualities
_Concept_: Agent embodies all precision qualities: never acts without verification, shows state changes before/after, builds recovery paths, explains reasoning.
_Novelty_: Holistic approach to safety culture rather than just features.

**[REVERSE-7]**: Smart Autopilot
_Concept_: Limited autopilot only for specific safe patterns (staging clean files, conventional commits), manual mode for risky operations.
_Novelty_: Balances convenience with appropriate caution.

**[REVERSE-8]**: Complete Trust Architecture
_Concept_: Preview mode + Undo anything + Explain reasoning + Never lose work - all trust features working together.
_Novelty_: Multi-layered trust approach addresses different user anxieties.

### User Creative Strengths

- **Safety-First Mindset**: Consistently prioritizes protection over convenience
- **Systems Thinking**: Sees git operations as interconnected flows, not isolated commands
- **Practical Vision**: Focuses on real pain points (staging, rebasing, commit splitting)
- **Quality Standards**: Values small, descriptive commits and clean history
- **Deep Engagement**: Thoughtfully considered each question, chose nuanced answers

### Creative Facilitation Narrative

This brainstorming session was driven by genuine pain points with current AI git tools. The user brought specific frustrations (agents losing awareness during operations, corrupted staging) that grounded the exploration in reality. Through SCAMPER and deep dive into Reverse Workflow Engineering, we discovered the core innovation: shifting from command-based to intent-based git operations with simulation-backed safety. The "surgical precisionist" persona emerged organically as the user consistently chose verification, explanation, and safety nets. The breakthrough moment was realizing that the agent shouldn't just execute commands safely - it should help users articulate what they want to achieve and then find the safest path there. This represents a paradigm shift from "git helper" to "git collaborator."

### Session Highlights

**Core Insights:**
1. Intent-driven operations > command execution
2. Dry-run previews are non-negotiable
3. Automatic snapshots enable fearless experimentation
4. Hybrid UI (natural language + visual) bridges power and usability
5. Surgical precisionist persona = verification + explanation + recovery

**Agent Identity Emerging:**
- **Name**: Needs to convey precision and safety
- **Persona**: Surgical precisionist, air traffic controller, paranoid vault keeper
- **Voice**: Calm, methodical, always explaining, never rushing
- **Core Promise**: "I never make a wrong cut"

**Key Differentiators:**
- Reverse workflow (outcome → path)
- Simulation before execution
- Context-aware undo strategies
- Smart autopilot with manual override
- Multi-layered trust architecture

## Idea Organization and Prioritization

**Thematic Organization:**

### Theme 1: Safety Architecture
- **Dry-Run Verification Gateway**: Preview before execution, explicit confirmation required
- **Safety-First Simulation Engine**: Pre-validate every path against corruption scenarios
- **Automatic Snapshots**: Recovery points before any operation sequence
- **Never Lose Work**: Multi-layered backup architecture

### Theme 2: Intent-Driven Operations
- **Reverse Workflow**: User declares outcomes, agent finds safe paths
- **Intelligent Ambiguity Resolution**: Asks clarifying questions when needed
- **Context-Aware Undo**: Multiple recovery strategies based on situation
- **Smart Autopilot**: Safe patterns automated, risky ops manual

### Theme 3: User Experience
- **Hybrid UI**: Natural language + visual confirmation
- **Air Traffic Controller**: Active coordinator with situational awareness
- **Medical Time-Out Protocol**: Pause and verify before finalizing
- **Surgical Precisionist**: Verification + explanation + recovery always

### Theme 4: Conventional Commits
- **Zero-Step Conventional Commits**: Auto-categorize and format based on changes

**Prioritization Results:**

User Priority Order:
1. **A) Intent-driven git operations** - Type what you want, agent figures out how
2. **B) Dry-run preview for all operations** - See exactly what will happen first
3. **C) Automatic snapshot + recovery system** - Never lose work, always recover
4. **D) Conventional commit automation** - Simplest feature, auto-format commits

**Implementation Strategy:**
- Phase 1: Core safety (B + C - dry-run + snapshots)
- Phase 2: Intent engine (A - reverse workflow)
- Phase 3: Polish (D - conventional commits + UX refinement)
