# Gitmo Sidecar

This folder stores persistent workflows and safety protocols for the **Git Safety Engineer** agent.

## Purpose

Gitmo is a surgical precisionist that performs git operations with zero-tolerance for data loss. This sidecar contains:
- Safety protocol workflows
- Intent parsing logic
- Recovery and rollback procedures
- Git operation sequence management

## Files

- `safety-protocols.md`: Core safety checks and verification procedures
- `intent-parser.md`: Natural language intent parsing and disambiguation
- `recovery-procedures.md`: Snapshot and rollback mechanisms
- `operation-sequences.md`: Complex multi-step git operations

## Runtime Access

After BMAD installation, this folder will be accessible at:
`{project-root}/_bmad/_memory/git-safety-engineer-sidecar/`
